Welcome! This repository contains my **personal learning roadmap** for mastering the pipeline of generating **3D models from 2D images using AI techniques**.

My long-term goal is to build a tool that can transform concept art, sketches, or photos into **game-ready 3D assets**, including mesh generation, rigging, and texture mapping ‚Äî deployable directly in engines like Unity, Unreal, or Godot.
